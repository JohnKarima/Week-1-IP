    </div>
    <div class="box1">
        <p>I'm a recent university graduate <em>(or I would be if Covid didn't happen).</em> Barring a few internships, my job experience is nonexistent. I've tried to get into prorgamming for the longest time...its actually a funny story. Like I joined university and there was this new shiny couse called Computer Science but which I only noticed after my second year of my <del>Business Management</del> degree.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">  
        <p>So rather than restart University, I decided to finish my degree in Buiness and pick up coding on the side. Coding for me is a way to bring things from my mind into the real world, and though I may be a long way from this, even the journey of a thousand miles begins with <strong>a single step</strong>.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy reading fiction(a little too much) and playing the saxophone.</p>
